For the battleground to start, all characters (between min and max player values) must be in the same tier. Tiers are set up in ranges of 10 levels except for level 70. So the first tier is 10-19, the next are 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and finally 70. If characters of different tiers all join the queue, they will join their respective tier's queue and wait for more players of their tier to join the queue. Characters in different tiers can never join the same battleground.

Character data
From UDB
Jump to: navigation, search
The following is a table containing indices and what values they contain for character.data. The source of this data is UpdateFields.h 

The .getvalue and .setvalue commands deal with the indices in this table. To modify any of the values in this table in real time, use the .setvalue command with the correct index (eg. .setvalue 4 2 0 sets the target's size to 2.00 (notice that it is a float, hence the 0 at the end)). 

All objects in the game (game objects, creatures, and players) share the OBJECT_* fields while only creatures and players share the UNIT_* fields while only players use the PLAYER_* fields. 

If you want to use direct SQL to extract a single value from this rather large blob, the syntax to use is this: 

SELECT CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', <index + 1>), ' ', -1) AS UNSIGNED) AS `fieldName` FROM `characters`;
Just replace <index + 1> with the index in this table and add one to it.
The reason why you are adding one is because of how the nested SUBSTRING_INDEX syntax works. Let's analyze the function calls. Working from the inside out, the first function called is SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', <index + 1>). The SUBSTRING_INDEX function creates a substring from the big data blob after <index + 1> spaces. Notice that if we used just <index>, the substring would be everything up to the value we want but not including it. The second function call is SUBSTRING_INDEX(<substring from inner function>, ' ', -1). This function call uses -1 as the count, meaning that it will substring from the end to the front. Since it is a count of one, it will create a substring that is exactly the value we want because the value we want is sandwiched between the end of the string and a space. The final function call CAST(<substring> AS UNSIGNED) casts the final string into an unsigned integer. This is because the data blob contains only numbers and if we cast the string into an integer, we can use integer operations on it (say if we use it in a WHERE clause to compare to another integer).

An example of the syntax in use is the following query where we are making a list of characters and their levels who have more than 1000 gold. 

SELECT `guid`, `name`, CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', 35), ' ', -1) AS UNSIGNED) AS `level` FROM `characters` 
   WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', 1398), ' ', -1) AS UNSIGNED) > 10000000;



If you want to edit the value of one of these fields, the query to do that is the following but don't forget to backup your table first: 

UPDATE `characters` SET `data`=CONCAT(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', <index>) AS CHAR), ' ', <value>, ' ', 
   CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', <-(max index - index) - 1>)AS CHAR)) [WHERE ...]
Replace "<index>" with the index that you want to change (look at table below), "<-(max index - index) -1>" with the negative of the subtraction of the last index (look at table) minus the index that you want to change and finally minus one. Finally replace "<value>" with the new value you want to put. 

For example, to reset gold to zero for all characters with level higher than 70, you can use the following query: 

UPDATE `characters` SET `data`=CONCAT(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', 1397) AS CHAR), ' ', 0, ' ',
CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', -131) AS CHAR)) WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX
(`data`, ' ', 35), ' ', -1) AS UNSIGNED) > 70; 
Again, don't forget to backup first!!

Creature (template) addon
From UDB

The `creature_(template)_addon` table 

The creature_addon and creature_template_addon tables define different things that are applied on creatures when they are loaded. These "different things" can be for example to have the creature be mounted, to have it emote something, to have it display an aura effect, etc. Through the use of the fields in this table, many things can be changed about the outward visual appearance of the creature. The creature_template_addon table affects all creatures with that creature template ID while the creature_addon table affects individually spawned creatures (so that two creatures using the same template can look different). 

NOTE: A creature_addon record will override a creature_template_addon record should they overlap on the same creature. 

NOTICE: The data for this table is largely incomplete and is mostly just a regurgitation of what the client receives from the server. This article is a WIP as to what all the possible values are.

Note: MONSTER_MOVE_SPLINE_FLY = MONSTER_MOVE_WALK + MONSTER_MOVE_SPLINE and makes creature fly by points. 

auras
This field controls any auras to be applied on the creature (both in effect and visually). The syntax for for an individual aura entry is "<spell ID> <index>". An aura is defined not just by the spell that applies it but also by the individual spell affect that applies it. Therefore, the effect index must be specified along with the spell ID. Each spell can have a maximum of three spell effects, so the effect index can only be 0, 1, or 2. To apply multiple auras, you can add more aura entries, separating each entry by a space. Remember that if a spell applies multiple auras, you need to specify an aura entry for each effect index if you want to apply more than one aura from the same spell. 

NOTE: Currently (Rev 5067) auras defined in creature_template_addon are not being properly added. Only add auras for creatures in creature_addon. 

List of useful aura entries: 

¦'16380 0' - Makes the creature invisible. 
¦'18950 0 18950 1' - Makes the creature detect other invisible units (players or creatures).

Summoning Table Introduction 
This table is used to provide NPC support for an event using action 32 = ACTION_T_SUMMON as one of its Actions. To quote from the Event_AI page: 

¦32 = ACTION_T_SUMMON: Summons a creature using the data specified in the separate summons table. 
¦Parameter 1: The creature template ID to be summoned. The value here needs to be a valid creature template ID. 
¦Parameter 2: The target type defining who the summoned creature will attack. The value in this field needs to be a valid target type as specified in the reference tables below. NOTE: Using target type 0 will cause the summoned creature to not attack anyone. 
¦Parameter 3: The summon ID from the eventai_summons table controlling the position (and spawntime) where the summoned mob should be spawned at. 
As we see from Parameter 3, this table will be controlling the arrival point of the NPC. If you wish for the NPC to spawn at the same point as the NPC spawning it, use Action 12 instead of 32. 

Explaining the Fields of the Table 
id
This arbitrary value will be matched by the third parameter in the 32 = ACTION_T_SUMMON Event Type. It does not need to be in solid descending order. 

Tip: Be sure to start your first custom input at least 1,000 digits ahead of the latest entry when you first start editing this table. I.e. in a newly installed database that you plan on working with for the long term, if the last id value here is 9, start at 5000, not at 10. If your database gets an update, if you had started at 10, those values could be overwritten. 

position_x
The X position of the NPC to be spawned. (Note that this will obviously take place on the same map that you and the NPC are on, so no Map number will be necessary here.) 

position_y
The Y position of the NPC to be spawned. 

position_z
The Y (height) position of the NPC to be spawned. 

orientation
The orientation of the NPC when it appears. It can be any value, (experiment as necessary) but here are some values already known: 

This value is measured in radians. 

Value  Direction  
0  North  
1.57  East  
3.14  South  
-1.57  West  
spawntimesecs
(Requires an elaboration and confirmation) - Most likely the time for the NPC to disappear once it has been summoned, in seconds. 

comment
The arbitrary string of text that you deposit into the table to describe the actions of this particular record in the table. The comment has no bearing on the table's effects other than your own ability to recognize what each record is doing.

Creature movement
From UDB
The `creature_movement` table 

This table holds all the information on each creature's waypoints. In essence, a waypoint just defines a path that the creature will follow by going from point to point.

If you have any questions regarding EventAI, please direct them Here. Of course, it is a good idea to thoroughly study this guide and take a look at your own database tables before asking questions. If you're truly stumped by something, then come and ask a question. 

(spacer) 

Now on to the fun stuff... 

Starting with revision 220, ScriptDev2 has implemented a DB-based scripting design that allows the use of a database (MySQL only right now) to specify the actions that a creature script will do. The script is called eventAI and will be so called throughout the rest of this guide. A basic eventAI script works with and requires only two pieces of information: What to do and When to do it. The first piece of information (the What) will be referred to as the action. Currently, a single eventAI script entry can have up to three actions. The second piece of information (the When) will be referred to as the event. Anyone that wants to create entries for the eventAI script needs to answer the two questions above. Throughout the script's lifecycle, it will continually perform the actions given when a defined event happens. Some events will only occur once while others can be timed so that they occur at a specified interval. 

Now that the basic idea of the script has been explained, let's get down to the fun details. For convenience, reference tables will be provided at the end of this article that will contain short descriptions for fast lookup. Here will be included longer and more thorough descriptions. We shall first start out with what events are currently defined by the eventAI script. An event can use up to three different parameters and these parameters control different things depending on the event. If a parameter isn't specifically named for the event, it will not be used for that event. 

One more thing: event AI can support phases. A "phase" is just a way to group certain events + actions together so that the creature will perform certain actions based on what event it is currently on. The way the phase system works in event AI is that for every event added, it needs to be specified under which phases the event SHOULD NOT occur. This is a bit confusing at first, so let's look at it more closely. A creature can have more than one phase, up to a max of 32 different phases (with the first one being phase 0, and last one being phase 31). How the phase selection field works is that it contains a 32bit number. Each bit in the number represents a possible phase, with the bit in the least significant position signifying phase 0 and the most significant bit signifying phase 31. The default value of zero in this field has no bits set and since the field controls when the event should NOT trigger, it would then mean that the event will always be triggered independent of the current phase the creature is in. Therefore, if you want to specify what phases the event should occur in, you need to add up all of the corresponding bits for all the other phases where the event shouldn't trigger in (confusing...yes). 

For example, let's say that a certain creature using event AI will have a max of four phases. We are then dealing with a 4 bit number in this field. Let's further say that that certain creature has an event that will only trigger in its third phase (a timed spell cast for instance). Then the field should contain all of the phases the event SHOULDN'T be triggered in...then out of the four bits, we leave the third bit alone (off) and turn on all of the other bits so we get 1011 which is equal to 11, so we put in 11 as the inverse phase mask for the event entry. As another example, let's say that the same creature previously mentioned has another event that is only triggered in the first and fourth phases. This would mean that we need to ignore the second and third phases, so our bitmask would be 0110 which is equal to 6 so we put in 6 for this event's inverse phase mask field. Please note that both examples were tailored for a creature with four and only four phases. If you decide to add more phases later on, you will have to redefine all of the nonzero bitmasks for all of the mob's events. 

Every event also has a chance field that controls the chance of that event actually occurring. Using a value of 0 in this field will make the event never occur. Values are from 0 to 100. 




Common Questions 
1.My NPCs aren't executing their scripts in dungeons! 
1.Scroll down this page nearly to the bottom until you reach "Event Flags" - You'll see that the event_flags field needs to have a 2 or a 3 added to it, depending on whether it's for a raid or a Heroic instance, respectively. Most people forget this, and it won't work without the extra 2 or 3 added to the value already in that field. 
1.Does something have to be hostile for it to interact with me? 
1.No. It would be the first thought, as the most common type of event is 0, "In combat," but anything marked "OOC" ("Out of Combat") will work wonderfully for anything with faction 35. (friendly to everyone.) Look into event_type 1 and 10 for your solution. 
1.Can EventAI interact with Game Objects? 
1.Not really. The closest anyone has come out of casual experience (At least since 8/9/09) is to cast a spell which has been reconfigured via the spell_scripts table. That may be possible. Check the spell_scripts table action type 11, 12, and 13. They may be what you are looking for.

Now that all of the supported events have been listed and described, we shall now move on to the actions that can be performed. Each event can take up to three actions. The actions will all be performed when the event is triggered and they will be performed in the order that they have been defined. This means that, for a certain event, action 1 will be performed first, followed by action 2, then lastly by action 3. Just like event definitions, each action can use up to three different parameters but not all actions will use all three parameters. If a parameter isn't mentioned for an action, then that action does not need that parameter. 

Before we start to list and explain the different actions that can be taken, we must first look at how the eventAI targeting system works. Due to technical reasons in how targetting is handled, the eventAI script cannot target anything or anyone that is not in its threat list or is not the scripted creature itself. It also can't currently target anyone specific in its threat list except by their position in the threat list. However, even then it can only target specifically the current victim, the second unit in its threat list, and the last unit in its threat list. It can also target units in its threat list at random and has two options for that: anyone in its threat list at random, or anyone in its threat list excluding the unit with the most threat. Aside from all of those external targets, the script can always target itself. More information on the target types can be found in the reference tables at the end of this guide. 

One last note before we start looking at individual actions is about the texts. The eventAI script has support for localized text entries. Therefore, you can define what the mob will say in more than one language all in another table and the script will show the corresponding localized text to the corresponding client (english text to enUS/enGB clients, german text to deDE clients, etc). All of the localized text entries will have a unique text ID assigned to them and it is that text ID that will be used by any actions that require textual input. 

Action Explanations 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

¦0 = ACTION_T_NONE: Does nothing! 
¦1 = ACTION_T_SAY: Displays the -TextId as defined. In case -TextId2 and optionally -TextId3, the output will be randomized. Type text are defined in the eventai_texts table (say, yell, whisper, etc) along with other options for the text. All values are required to be negative. 
¦Parameter 1: The entry of the text that the NPC should use from eventai_texts table. Optionally a entry from other tables can be used (such as custom_texts).Entry are required to be negative and exist in a *_texts-table. The type text to be displayed are defined in the texts-table itself (Say, Yell, Whisper, Emote Text, Boss Whisper, Boss Emote)Other options are also to be defined in the texts-table, such as a sound to be heard with the text and the language used in output (common, dwarvish, etc).In case this entry has a localized version of the text, the localized text will be displayed in client that support this locale. 
¦Parameter 2: Optional. TextId can be defined in addition. The same apply to this as explained above, however eventAI will randomize between the two. 
¦Parameter 3: Optional, if Parameter 2 exist. In this case, eventAI will randomize between three. 
¦2 = ACTION_T_SET_FACTION: Change faction for creature. 
¦Parameter 1: FactionId of the desired faction. If param1==0, creature will revert to default faction. 
¦3 = ACTION_T_MORPH_TO_ENTRY_OR_MODEL: Set model from creature_template.entry(param1) OR set explicit modelId(param2). If param1 AND param2 both 0, demorph and revert to default model for creature. 
¦Parameter 1: CreatureEntry of the npc. 
¦Parameter 2: ModelId that needs to be changed to. 



¦4 = ACTION_T_SOUND: When activated, the creature will play the specified sound. 
¦Parameter 1: The sound ID to be played. Sound IDs are contained in the DBC files. 
¦5 = ACTION_T_EMOTE: When activated, the creature will perform a visual emote. Unlike a text emote, a visual emote is one where the creature will actually move or perform a gesture. 
¦Parameter 1: The emote ID that the creature should perform. Emote IDs are also contained in the DBC but they can be found in the mangos source as well. 
¦6 = ACTION_T_RANDOM_SAY: UNUSED 
¦7 = ACTION_T_RANDOM_YELL: UNUSED 
¦8 = ACTION_T_RANDOM_TEXTEMOTE: UNUSED 
¦9 = ACTION_T_RANDOM_SOUND: Similar to the ACTION_T_SOUND action, when this action is activated, it will choose at random a sound to play. This action needs all three parameters to be filled and it will pick a random entry from the three. NOTE: (1) 
¦Parameter 1: The sound ID to be played as choice one. 
¦Parameter 2: The sound ID to be played as choice two. 
¦Parameter 3: The sound ID to be played as choice three. 
¦10 = ACTION_T_RANDOM_EMOTE: Similar to the ACTION_T_EMOTE action, when this action is activated, it will choose at random an emote ID to emote visually. This action needs all three parameters to be filled and it will pick a random entry from the three. NOTE: (1) 
¦Parameter 1: The emote ID that the creature should perform as choice one. 
¦Parameter 2: The emote ID that the creature should perform as choice two. 
¦Parameter 3: The emote ID that the creature should perform as choice three.

¦25 = ACTION_T_FLEE: When activated, the creature will try to flee from combat. Currently this is done by it casting a fear-like spell on itself called "Run Away". 
¦26 = ACTION_T_QUEST_EVENT_ALL: This action does the same thing as the ACTION_T_QUEST_EVENT does but it does it for all players in the creature's threat list. Note that if a player is not in its threat list for whatever reason, he/she won't get the quest completed. 
¦Parameter 1: The quest ID to finish for everyone. 
¦27 = ACTION_T_CASTCREATUREGO_ALL: This action does the same thing as the ACTION_T_CASTCREATUREGO does but it does it for all players in the creature's threat list. Note that if a player is not in its threat list for whatever reason, he/she won't receive the cast emulation.

¦Parameter 2: The value to put at that field index. The number here must be a valid 32 bit number. 
¦35 = ACTION_T_SET_INST_DATA64: Sets GUID (64 bits) data for the instance based on the target. Note that this will only work when the creature is inside an instantiable zone that has a valid script (ScriptedInstance) assigned. 
¦Parameter 1: The field to change in the instance script. Again, this field needs to be a valid field that has been already defined in the instance's script. 
¦Parameter 2: The target type to use to get the GUID that will be stored at the field index. The value in this field needs to be a valid target type as specified in the reference tables below.

¦Parameter 1: Sheath state of the creature. 
¦41 = ACTION_T_FORCE_DESPAWN: Despawns the creature. 
(1) = Use -1 to specify that if this param is picked to do nothing. Random is constant between actions within an event. So if you have a random Yell and a random Sound they will match up (ex: param2 with param2)

Summary for the meek 
If you still don't understand what EventAI is, it's understandable. It's a very powerful table and can look confusing at first glance. I will elaborate on some of the concepts here. 

The event_type field determines what you need to put into the event_param1 - event_param4 fields. If your event_type is 0, (In-combat.) your parameters will need to be lengths of time (in milliseconds) in which the action will take place. If your event_type is 6, (on death) we won't need any parameters, as the condition has no possible parameters to work with. Death is death. We can't define what kind of death it should be, so there are no parameters necessary. 




Working with Phases 
Working with phases requires a certain amount of math. You will have to know a few things before we begin. 

1.You should have an idea of how many phases the NPC will have. 
2.You will have to know Binary Addition. Don't worry, I'll show you how to do it. 
- Binary Addition - 


¦0110 = 6 (base 10) 
¦0111 = 7 (base 10) 
¦____ = __ 
¦1101 = 13 (base 10) 



¦07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 <-- The place values. 
¦64 32 16 08 04 02 01 00 <-- Note how it doubles in size. This is what you add. 
_ 

¦_1 __ 1 __ 1 
¦04 + 02 + 01 = 07. 
_ 

¦_1 __ 0 __ 1 __ 1 __ 0 <-- Note how place 1, 2, and 4 are 1, but place 3 is not. 
¦08 + 04 + 02 + 01 + 00 = 11. 
So you add 1, 2, and 8 together to get 11. You do not add the 4, because its bit was a 0. 

__ __ __ 

Now back to Phases. 

The overall concept (not method, just yet!) of a phase, is a "section" of activities that the NPC will act on. Hypothetically speaking, if a boss uses Attack "X" only when above 50% health, and only uses attack "Y" only when below 50% health, the boss will be using two different phases. 

The concept: The "event_inverse_phase_mask" field is the field controlling phase information. Read the following sentence very carefully and memorize it. The number in this field represents the phases that this action will not be initiated in, including up to and less than the NPC's total number of phases. Keep this in the back of your head. The reason for this is because this number also casually tells the script how many phases the NPC has. It's surprisingly ingenious. 


This is where the Binary Addition comes into play. Suppose your NPC has three phases. It will start off in phase 1. (*) It will remain in phase 1 unless specifically told to by Action Types 22, 23, 30, and 31, which control phases mid-game once the script is already running. 

* (I should mention right here that anything with an event_inverse_phase_mask of 0 will happen in all phases.) 

Suppose we wanted to have an attack that is only used in the NPC's first phase. You know that the NPC will have three phases. You would set up the attack as usual, but in the event_inverse_phase_mask field, you would put a 6. Why the six? Let's take a look. 

We have three phases. We will represent these like this: 
¦_3__2__1__<-- Represents the Phase Number and the bit. 
¦04 02 01 
Phase 1's bit is 1. Phase 2's bit is 2. Phase 3's bit is 4. (If we had a phase 4, it would be 8, and phase 5 would be 16, etc.) To get 6, we have added the 2 and the 4 from the 2nd and 3rd phases. As was mentioned above, the number that goes into that field represents the bitmask of the phases that the action will not take place in. 

Quick Phase Reference 
This list is for an easy reference of what phase equates to what number, if you're not very phase-savvy. The "Value" column is what goes into the "event_inverse_phase_mask" field. The "Phase" column indicates the phase number that the hypothetical mob or boss is in that the event WILL happen in. This field relies on the next field, the "Max Phases" field. That is the amount of total phases the mob has. (I.e. my boss has 2 phases, or my boss has 4 phases.) Then there is a description field for any numerical work involved. It is the least important field, and can safely be ignored. 

Remember, anything with "0" as a phase will occur in all phases. It is 0 by default. 

Again, this is based on the following number patterns: 

00 + 01 + 02 + 03 + 04 + 05 + 06 + 07 + 008 - Represents Phases. 

00 + 01 + 02 + 04 + 08 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 - The numerical representations of those phases. 

And, once again, how this works, is: 

1.You look at the total number of phases. Suppose it's 3.
2.You cover up all the numbers to the right of phase 3, which corresponds to the 04 right below it.
3.Then you decide which phase you want the event to occur in.
4.Then you look at all other phases, and add up the number beneath them.
5.The number you come up with goes in the "Value" field below in that chart, and what will go into the event_inverse_phase_mask field.

The reference chart will only go down to 4 phases for now. There is no small limit on the amount of phases except for your patience, and possibly 255. If anyone wants to fill in the rest of the chart, many thanks will be due to the brave and bored soul who does it. 


Reminder: Once again, if your creatures don't perform your actions within Dungeons, you need to add "1" to the current value of the "Event_flags" column.

SuggestedPlayers
Info about how many players should do unite for the quest. 

LimitTime
Time in seconds that the player has to complete this quest. 

QuestFlags
This flag field defines more specifically the type of quest it is. Aside from the daily flag and sharable flag, this field is used just for grouping purposes and NOT for any other quest requirements. The quest requirements are calculated from non-zero values in other quest template fields. Also, while some of these flags are known, others have yet an unknown purpose and the comments below is simply guesswork on them. 

At the moment (rev 6055), the core does not actually handle these flags any differently (again, except for the daily flag and the sharable flag). 

Bit  Name  Comments  
0  QUEST_FLAGS_NONE  No flags, so no groups assigned to this quest.  
1  QUEST_FLAGS_STAY_ALIVE  If the player dies, the quest is failed. (?)  
2  QUEST_FLAGS_EVENT  Escort quests or any other event-driven quests. If player in party, all players that can accept this quest will receive confirmation box to accept quest.  
4  QUEST_FLAGS_EXPLORATION  Involves the activation of an areatrigger.  
8  QUEST_FLAGS_SHARABLE  Allows the quest to be shared with other players.  
16  QUEST_FLAGS_NONE2  Unknown at this time and not used.  
32  QUEST_FLAGS_EPIC  Epic class quests (hunter) (??)  
64  QUEST_FLAGS_RAID  Raid or similar player group needed for quest.  
128  QUEST_FLAGS_TBC  Added with or after TBC.  
256  QUEST_FLAGS_UNK2  Quest needs extra non-objective items dropped (eg. ReqSourceID fields) (?)  
512  QUEST_FLAGS_HIDDEN_REWARDS  Item and monetary rewards are hidden in the initial quest details page and in the quest log but will appear once ready to be rewarded.  
1024  QUEST_FLAGS_AUTO_REWARDED  These quests are automatically rewarded on quest complete and they will never appear in quest log client side.  
2048  QUEST_FLAGS_TBC_RACES  Blood elf/draenei starting zone quests.  
4096  QUEST_FLAGS_DAILY  Daily repeatable quests (only flag that the core applies specific behavior for)  
8192  QUEST_FLAGS_UNK5  Grizzly Hills PvP daily? Once quest is accepted the player's PvP is enabled.  

Like all flag based fields, QuestFlags can be added for the different types of quest. 

SpecialFlags
This field is a bitmask and controls only two extra requirements and has only 4 possible values. 

¦0: No extra requirements 
¦1: Makes the quest repeatable. 
¦2: Makes the quest only completable by some external event (an entry in areatrigger_involvedrelation, spell effect quest complete or an entry in spell_scripts with command 7 as some examples) 
¦3: Both repeatable and completable only through an external event 
CharTitleId
The title the character will receive upon completion of the quest. See CharTitles.dbc 

PlayersSlain
BonusTalents
PrevQuestId
if value > 0: Contains the previous quest id, that must be completed before this quest can be started. 

If value < 0: Contains the parent quest id, that must be active before this quest can be started. 

See the examples section for examples. 

NextQuestId
If value > 0: Contains the next quest id, if PrevQuestId of that quest is not sufficient. 

If value < 0: Contains the sub quest id, if PrevQuestId of that quest is not sufficient. If quest have many alternative next quests (class specific quests lead from single not class specific quest) field PrevQuestId in next quests can used for setting this dependence. 

See the examples section for examples. 

ExclusiveGroup
if ExclusiveGroup > 0 

Allows to define a group of quests of which only one may be chosen and completed. E.g. if from quests 1200, 1201 and 1202 only one should be allowed to be chosen, insert 1200 into ExclusiveGroup of all 3 quests. 

if ExclusiveGroup < 0 

Allows to define a group of quests of which all must be completed and rewarded to start next quest. E.g. if quest 1000 dependent from one of quests 1200, 1201 and 1202 and all this quests have same negative exclusive group then all this quest must be completed and rewarded before quest 1000 can be started. 

See the examples section for examples. 

NextQuestInChain
The quest entry from a creature or gameobject that ends a quest and starts a new one. The result is, that if you end the quest, the new quest instantly appears from the quest giver. 

See the examples section for examples. 

SrcItemId
Item's ID given by the quest giver at beginning of the quest. Items will be deleted when quest is abandoned. 

SrcItemCount
Amount of items given. 

SrcSpell
Spell casted on player when quest is started. Can be a buff or a learning spell. 

Title
Title of the quest. 

Details
The quest text. You can use certain placeholders that will be filled in in-game: $B - line break, $N - name, $R - race, $C - class, $Gmale:female; (male and female can be replace with any synonymn you want, but the order must stay the same. IE: boy:girl / man:woman / sir:madam / dude:chick) 

Objectives
Objectives of the quest. If empty, quest is an auto-complete quest that can be immediately finished without accepting it first. 

OfferRewardText
First text send to the player by the NPC when completing the quest. You can use certain placeholders that will be filled in in-game: $B - line break, $N - name, $R - race, $C - class, $Gmale:female; (male and female can be replace with any synonymn you want, but the order must stay the same. IE: boy:girl / man:woman / sir:madam / dude:chick) 

RequestItemsText
Text sent to player when the player tries to talk to the NPC with the quest active but incomplete. (The text under the "Progress" title in Wowhead.) You can use certain placeholders that will be filled in in-game: $B - line break, $N - name, $R - race, $C - class, $Gmale:female; (male and female can be replace with any synonymn you want, but the order must stay the same. IE: boy:girl / man:woman / sir:madam / dude:chick) 

EndText
Used only when SpecialFlags 2 is active. This is the objective text sent to the player describing the external event that is required to complete the quest. 

ObjectiveText
Used to define non-standard objective texts, that show up in the questlog. Example, "Heal fallen warrior" and the number gets added by Count values. 

ReqItemId
Item_template Id of required item to complete the quest. 

ReqItemCount
Amount of required items 

ReqSourceID
Item ID that is needed indirectly by the quest. For example, the quests asks for item X but the only way to get item X is by activating item Y; however, item Y is also a quest item. Therefore you set item Y's ID in this field. This requirement will not appear in the quest text, it is just for the core to know when to drop a quest item that isn't in the ReqItemID field but is still needed by the quest. 

ReqSourceCount
The maximum number of copies of the item in ReqSourceID that can be picked up (and dropped by the core). Having ReqSourceId !=0 and ReqSourceCount for that = 0, there is no limit for the items to drop. 

ReqCreatureOrGOId
Value > 0: required creature_template ID the player needs to kill/cast on in order to complete the quest. 

Value < 0: required gameobject_template ID the player needs to cast on in order to complete the quest. 

If ReqSpellCast is != 0, the objective is to cast on target, else kill. 

NOTE: If ReqSpellCast is != 0 and the spell has effects Send Event or Quest Complete, this field may be left empty. 

ReqCreatureOrGOCount
The number of times the creature or gameobject must be killed or casted upon. 

ReqSpellCast
Spell ID of Spell that needs to be cast in order to fulfill a quest objective. A spell normally needs a target which is ReqCreatureOrGOId 

And for spells with "SpellEffect with ImpliciteTargetA-B == 38" check table Spell_script_target 

NOTE: If the spell has spell effects Send Event or Quest Complete, it can be entered here WITHOUT the need for a target and count. 

RewChoiceItemId, RewChoiceItemCount
Id of item available for reward choice. 

Number of Charges in rewarded item available. 




RewItemId, RewItemCount
Number of RewItem 

item Id given for reward (no choice). 

RewRepFaction, RewRepValue
Faction Id (from Faction.dbc) for which the quest give reputation points. 

Number of gain or lost reputation points for Faction at quest completion. This is special reputation rewarding. Normal reputation reward to quest rewarding creature faction calculated and added automatically. 

RewHonorableKills
Number of honorable kill honor rewarded for completing this quest. 

Example: An example value is 15 for quest 8388: At level 70 an honorable kill is 20.9 honor worth. Multiply this with 15 and you receive 313.5, after the multiplication the value is rounded up. So the honor rewarded at level 70 is 314 for this quest. 

RewOrReqMoney
Money earned by completing the quest (if value > 0). Money quest requirement (if value < 0). 

RewMoneyMaxLevel
The money a character at level 70 would get when they complete this quest. This field also controls the XP given as the XP is calculated from the value in this field by the following formula. If the quest is repeatable, XP will be given only once. The total XP that a character will receive is also affected by the level difference between the character's level and the quest's level. 

The formula for calculating XP from the value in this field:
QuestLevel >= 65: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 6.0
QuestLevel == 64: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 4.8
QuestLevel == 63: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 3.6
QuestLevel == 62: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 2.4
QuestLevel == 61: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 1.2
QuestLevel <= 60: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 0.6 

RewSpell
Spell that is shown to be casted on quest completion in the quest log. Note that this spell will NOT be casted if RewSpellCast is non-zero. The spell in the other field will be casted instead, in which case the spell here only serves as the visual in the quest log. 

NOTE: This field comes straight from the WDB and should not be changed. 

RewSpellCast
Spell that will always be casted at player when completing the quest. This can be learn spell and player learned some spell in result, or buff spell, for example. If this field is non-zero then this spell will ALWAYS be casted and the spell in RewSpell will not. 

NOTE: This field comes straight from the WDB and should not be changed. 

RewMailTemplateId
If the quest gives as a reward an item from a possible list of items, the ID here corresponds to the proper loot template in quest_mail_loot_template. According to the rules in that loot template, items "looted" will be sent by mail at the completion of the quest. 

RewMailDelaySecs
How many seconds to wait until the mail is sent to the character that turned in a quest rewarding items from a loot template defined in RewMailTemplateId 

PointMapId
MapId of a quest point of interest (POI - Point Of Interest). POI will be shown on the map when quest is active. 

PointX
X coordinate of quest POI. 

PointY
Y coordinate of quest POI. 

PointOpt
DetailsEmote

Examples
The "rules of engagement" dealing with quests 

1. Always use PrevQuestId before using NextQuestId. NextQuestId is considered optional and to be used only when PrevQuestId is not sufficient 


Basic quest 

Single, stand-alone quest with no prerequisites 

    *questA*
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = 0        entry = questA
When this quest require another quest to be rewarded 

    *questA*
PrevQuestId = questX   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = 0        entry = questA
Chain of quests 

Player get quests in a strict chain that must be completed in a specific order. 

    *questA*
        |
    *questB*
        |
    *questC*
        |
    *questD*
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = questB    entry = questA
PrevQuestId = questA   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = questC    entry = questB
PrevQuestId = questB   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questC
PrevQuestId = questC   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questD
Chain of quests with multiple start quests. 

Player should only be allowed to complete one of three possible 

    *questA*     *questB*    *questC*
        \           |           /
          ------ *questD* -----
                    |
                 *questE*
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = questD   ExclusiveGroup = questA   NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questA
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = questD   ExclusiveGroup = questA   NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questB

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = questE    entry = questD
PrevQuestId = questD   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questE

Chain of quests with multiple start quests. 

Player must complete all three initial quests before D becomes available 

    *questA*    *questB*    *questC*
        \          |          /
         ------ *questD* -----
                   |
                *questE*
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = questD   ExclusiveGroup = -questA    NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questA

PrevQuestId = questD   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questE

Quests with split and a child quest 

Completing A unlocks B and C that can be done at the same time. They both need to be completed before D becomes available. X is needed to obtain item for C and this quest should only be available if C is active 

                *questA*
                /        \
           *questB     *questC* - *questX*

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0         NextQuestInChain = 0        entry = questD

Multiple quest chains, leading to one final quest 

Player may complete (not required to) X, but has to complete all three quest chains before final quest becomes available 

                *questX*
                   |
    *questA*    *questC*    *questE*

    *questB*    *questD*    *questF*
       \           |           /
         ------ *questG* -----

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = questB    entry = questA
PrevQuestId = questA   NextQuestId = questG    ExclusiveGroup = -questB    NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questB
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questC
PrevQuestId = questC   NextQuestId = questG    ExclusiveGroup = -questB    NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questD
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = questF    entry = questE

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questG

Complicated 

Player must first complete A, then B to unlock the chain from C to E. Three other quests in a group will also be unlocked, those can be done at the same time. The three grouped quests must all be completed before I becomes available. Completion of E and I is required to obtain the final quest. 

                *questA*
                   |
                *questB*

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questJ

Impossible - many quests may unlock many 

Player can choose between two alternative chains (Chain A or B, but not both chains). A2 or B2 should unlock C, D and E when complete. When all three complete, F should be unlocked. If player get A3 or B3 after complete F, depends on if chain A or B was chosen. 

                *questA1*           *questB1*
                    |                   |

                    *questA3*   *questB3*
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = questA2   entry = questA1
PrevQuestId = questA1  NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questA2

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = questB2   entry = questB1
PrevQuestId = questB1  NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questB2

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = questF    ExclusiveGroup = -questC    NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questC
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = questF    ExclusiveGroup = -questC    NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questD

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questF

PrevQuestId = questF   NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questA3
PrevQuestId = questF   NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questB3
Note: if player can choose between chain A or B may be determined by faction status (aldor or scryer), using ReqMinRepFaction = 1. Player should not be able to be neutral+1 with both at the same time. This may be the common threshold to obtain aldor or scryer quests (this is unsure). If that is the case, only the unlock of C, D and E after complete A2 _or_ B2 is the impossible part.

FactionTemplate.dbc
From UDB

`FactionTemplate` dbc 

This dbc contains information on all of the individual factions. A faction entry from this dbc contains all of the needed data to calculate hostility, friendliness, or neutrality to any other faction in this dbc. 

IMPORTANT: These values are only used for the creature_template and gameobject_template tables.

Explanations & Calculations
Each different entry has different relations towards any other faction. 


The easiest calculation when calculating hostility or friendliness is to look at the Friend factions and Enemy factions columns in the table below. If our faction has the other faction's ID in the Enemy factions list, then it is hostile to that faction (at least). The same thing applies for a friendliness check on the Friend factions column. 




If our faction doesn't have the other faction's ID in the enemy or friend faction list, then we'll have to get more complicated in calculating hostility or friendliness. 

First, let's define the four faction groups: 

ID  Bit  Name  
0  1  All players (and pets)  
1  2  Alliance players (and their pets)  
2  4  Horde players (and their pets)  
3  8  Monster (Not a player nor a pet)  


The first mask (ourMask) defines what type of faction we are dealing with. Eg, faction 1 (PLAYER, Human) has 3 as ourMask; that means that it has the first two bits set so it classifies as both 'All players' and 'Alliance players'. 


The second mask (friendlyMask) defines what faction groups this faction is friendly with. That means that if this field contains the bit for a faction group, then it is friendly with that faction. Eg, faction 5 (PLAYER, Undead) has 4 as friendlyMask; that means that it has the third bit set so it is friendly with 'Horde players'. 


The third mask (hostileMask) defines what faction groups this faction is hostile with. This faction will be hostile to any faction group whose bit is set in this field. For example, let's examine the first two Stormwind factions. The first one (faction 11) has hostileMask 12. The binary representation of this is 1100, with the third and fourth bits set. The second Stormwind faction (faction 12) has hostileMask 4. The binary representation of this is 0100, with the third bit set. Applying the formulas to these two values, we can see that faction 11 is hostile to Horde players and also anything that is not a player while faction 12 is only hostile to Horde players. Faction 12 will not aggro any creature that is part of the monster faction group. 


For the mathematically inclined, the basic formula to test for friendliness is 

(friendlyMask & other.ourMask) != 0 
...where other is another faction. The same thing applies for hostility: 

(hostileMask & other.ourMask) != 0
For the not so mathematically inclined, we'll have to compare two binary numbers. First, you will need to convert all of the masks to binary form with four digits; so 1 becomes 0001, 2 becomes 0010, 3 becomes 0011, etc. 

Second, line up the friendlyMask or hostileMask value with the ourMask value. For example: 

     1100 //hostileMask of faction 11
     1000 //ourMask of faction 14
Next, perform a logical 'AND' on the two numbers, the bottom one with the one on top and follow these rules: 

¦1 and 1 is 1 
¦1 and 0 is 0 
¦0 and 1 is 0 
¦0 and 0 is 0 
So, continuing our example: 

     1100
     1000
     ----
     1000
Finally, check the result that you get with the value 0. Only 0000 will equal 0, anything else will not equal 0. If the result 'does not' equal 0, then the faction is hostile/friendly to the other faction. In our example, it is obvious that we do not have 0 (we have 8 in fact if you convert to base 10 again), so faction 11 is hostile to faction 14 and will aggro it. 




From all of the above calculations, we notice that if ourMask for a faction is 0 (that means 0000), it will be neutral to everything (not necessarily friendly). If the friendlyMask for a faction is 0, then it will never be friendly to anything or anyone (unless it has other faction IDs in the Friend factions column in the table below). Finally, if the hostileMask for a faction is 0, it will never be hostile to anything or anyone (again there may be exceptions in the Enemy factions column in the table below). 


To summarize, you should follow these steps to calculate if faction A is hostile to faction B: 

1.Look for faction B in the Enemy faction list of faction A in the table below 
¦If found, then faction A is hostile to faction B and you can stop 
¦If not found, then continue with the next steps 
2.Look up hostileMask for faction A in table below 
3.Look up ourMask for faction B in table below 
4.Do the and (&) operation on the two values 
¦If the result is 0, then faction A is not hostile to faction B (but not necessarily friendly either) 
¦If the result is not 0, then faction A IS hostile to faction B 
And these steps to calculate if faction A is friendly to faction B: 

1.Look for faction B in the Friend faction list of faction A in the table below 
¦If found, then faction A is friendly to faction B and you can stop 
¦If not found, then continue with the next steps 
2.Look up friendlyMask for faction A in table below 
3.Look up ourMask for faction B in table below 
4.Do the and (&) operation on the two values 
¦If the result is 0, then faction A is not friendly to faction B (but not necessarily hostile either) 
¦If the result is not 0, then faction A IS friendly to faction B

Loot template
From UDB

The `*_loot_template` tables 

General
Well, according to vocabulary the meaning of the word "loot" is good for corpse loot and may be for some gameobjects like chests but quite unfit for fishing "loot". Nevermind. We will use term "loot" here as "a set of items generated on an event for a player" and "loot definition" as "a set of rules for loot generation". And forget about vocabulary for a while. 

This table format is used for 11 different tables to generate different loot items for different things. The 11 tables are creature_loot_template, disenchant_loot_template, fishing_loot_template, gameobject_loot_template, item_loot_template, pickpocketing_loot_template, prospecting_loot_template, skinning_loot_template, quest_mail_loot_template, reference_loot_template, milling_loot_template. The general description here is valid for all 11 because the loot system is the same for all eleven. 

Loot templates define only items in the loot. See comments about money drop in corpse, pickpocketing and luggage loot in creature_template and item_template.

Description of the fields
entry
The ID of the loot definition (loot template). The rows with the same ID defines a single loot. 
It is often the same ID as the loot source (item, creature, etc) but when the link is made not on entry field of the Related table then ID can be different. For example, when several loot sources should provide the same loot, single loot definition can be used. In this case the loot sources have the same value in the link field. 

It is possible also to set up artificial loot templates which are not used directly at all as they have ID which are not referenced from the related source. Such "support templates" can be referenced from "normal" loot templates. 

When a common or artificial loot template is used a problem arises: what ID to use for that template? Depending on the loot table, different rules can be agreed on to simplify maintenance for the table. Moreover, such rules would be very handy but it seems at the moment there are very few rules explicitly defined. 

Agreements on entry field values are described there. 

item
Template ID of the item which can be included into the loot. 

NOTE: For reference entries this field has no meaning and not used by the core in any way. Yet because of the PRIMARY KEY on the entry + item combination, this field will nonetheless need to be a unique number for each reference entry so that no indexing conflicts arise. 

ChanceOrQuestChance
Meaning of that field is a bit different depending on its sign and the sign of mincountOrRef: 

Plain entry
ChanceOrQuestChance > 0, mincountOrRef > 0 

Absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance (actuallu just the value as it's positive in this case) signifies the percent chance that the item has to drop. Any floating point number is allowed but indeed any value larger that 100 will make the same result as 100. 

Quest drop
ChanceOrQuestChance < 0, mincountOrRef > 0 

Just as for plain entries absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance signifies the percent chance that the item has to drop. But in addition negative ChanceOrQuestChance informs the core that the item should be shown only to characters having appropriate quest. This means that even if item is dropped, in order to see it in the loot the player must have at least one quest that has the item ID in its ReqItemIdN fields or in its ReqSourceIdN fields. The player must also have less copies of the item than ReqItemCountN or ReqSourceCountN. 

Chanced references
mincountOrRef < 0 

For negative mincountOrRef (reference entries) ChanceOrQuestChance signifies the percent chance that the reference has to be used. So it is very similar to plain entries meaning, just note that entire reference is skipped if the chance is missed. 

Negative and zero values of ChanceOrQuestChance make no sense for that case and should not be used. 

Common remarks
Zero value of ChanceOrQuestChance is allowed for grouped entries only. 

(Non-zero) values of ChanceOrQuestChance in loot definition are multiplied by RATE_DROP_ITEMS (mangos config setting) during loot generation for references and non-reference entries, but not for grouped entries. 

groupid
A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields. 

A group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance) and equal-chanced (ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: 

¦all equal-chanced entries have the same chance 
¦group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% 
Of course group may consist of 

¦only explicitly-chanced entries or 
¦only equal-chanced entries or 
¦entries of both type. 
The easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: 

At loading time: 

¦groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. 
During loot generation: 

¦core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): 
¦a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). 
¦chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: 
¦if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry 'wins': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. 
¦otherwise the entry 'looses': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. 
¦if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: 
¦a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. 
¦If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. 
Let us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). 

If you understand the process you can understand the results: 

¦Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. 
¦If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. 
¦If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance. 
¦If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R. So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance. That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. 
¦Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. 
So now basic applications of the groups are clear: 

¦Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. 
¦Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. 
¦A single group may be defined for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. 
There is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. 

Note: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. 

Note: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this "16") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. 

Note: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. 

mincountOrRef
This field defines 

¦when positive: the minimum number of copies of the item that can drop in a single loot 
¦when negative: a reference to another template. 
Zero value makes no sense and should not be used. 

Meaning of positive values is quite clear and requires no additional comments. References can point to either a whole template or to single group of a template and decribed below. 

Template reference
mincountOrRef < 0, group = 0 

Template reference asks core to process another loot template (having entry equal to "-mincountOrRef") and to include all items dropped for that template into current loot. Simple idea. 

Value of maxcount field is used as a repetition factor for references - the reference will be processed not just once but exactly maxcount times. So if the referenced template can produce 3 to 10 items (depending on luck) and value of maxcount is '5' then after processing of that reference 15 to 50 items will be added to the loot. An awful example, isn't it? Actually no good example for whole template reference repetition is known, but it is quite useful for group references sometimes. 

Be careful. Self references (loot template includes reference to itself) and loop references (loot template A includes reference to entire template B, loot template B includes reference to entire template A) are completely different from internal references. If you make a self-reference like 

INSERT INTO `creature_loot_template` (`entry`,`item`,`mincountOrRef`) VALUES ('21215','0','-21215'); 

then the core will crash due to stack overflow at first attempt of loot 21215 processing. That is why self references and loop references are strictly forbidden. 

Group reference
mincountOrRef < 0, group > 0 

Group reference asks core to process another loot template (having entry equal to "-mincountOrRef") only in the part of one group - with id equal to value of `groupid` field of the reference entry. So this reference may add only none or 1 item into the loot (provided maxcount is equal to 1). 

Meaning of maxcount field value is the same as described in Template reference. 

Note that there is no way to have a reference as a part of a group as such grouped reference would have the same format as reference to group described here. 

There are two types of group references: 

¦external reference when group reference row has entry different from entry of the referenced group 
¦internal reference when group reference row has the same entry as the referenced group. 
Basic usage of group references is to avoid repetition of group definitions when several loot sources have common parts of the loot. In this case it is possible: 

¦to define groups with the same contents (items/drop chances) again and again. The simpliest way, but very RAM consumable. 
¦to define the group once as a part of one of loot source loot definition and to include group references in loot definitions of the other loot sources instead of repeating group definition. 
¦to define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition (having entry not corresponding to any source) and to include group references in loot definitions for every related loot source. 
The first way is deprecated, both second and third use external references. UDB recommends to use the third way. 

As references have chance to be processed it is possible to use them effiently for zone or world drop definitions. Those drops often have different chances for different loot sources (low/high skill gameobjects, non-elite/elite creatures etc) while having the same contents of the loot. The recommended way to define such drops is as following: 

¦to set up a group with 100% group chance in an artificial loot template (using equal-chanced entries when possible) 
¦to include references to that group into loot definition of every related loot source setting the drop chance for the reference. 
Some bosses drop more than one tier item (two or three). Loot statistics looks like the same group is rolled 2 or 3 times and every time an item (possible the same) is chosen. It is simple to define a group for single item, but how to define drop for the second and the third? We can: 

¦repeat group definition 2 (or 3) times with change of group id 
¦define the group once and include 1 (or 2) internal references. 
¦define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition and include 2 (or 3) external group references. 
¦define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition and include an external group reference with repetition factor of 2 (or 3). 
The in-game results will be the same. But again - the first way is very inefficient and then deprecated. UDB recommends to use the forth way. 

maxcount
For non-reference entries - the maximum number of copies of the item that can drop in a single loot. 

For references value of maxcount field is used as a repetition factor for references - the reference will be processed not just once but exactly maxcount times. This is designed to serve a single purpose: to make definition of tier token drops a bit simplier (tokens of a tier are defined as a 100%-chance group of an artificial template and bosses' loot templates include 100%-chanced reference to that group with repetition factor of 2 or 3 depending on the case). Using non-1 repetition factor for other things (references to a group with group chance less than 100% or chanced references with chance less than 100%) must be agreed with UDB devs first (and described here). 

Note: core rolls chance for any loot definition entry just one time - so if a references looses its chance it is skipped for the current loot completely whatever is maxcount value. 

lootcondition
Value that represents a loot condition that must be filled in order for the item to drop. This field combined with condition_value1-2 fields can provide conditions on when an item can be dropped. 

Value  Condition  Comments  
0  CONDITION_NONE  Regular drop  
1  CONDITION_AURA  Player looting must have an aura active  
2  CONDITION_ITEM  Player must have a number of items in his/her inventory  
3  CONDITION_ITEM_EQUIPPED  Player must have an item equipped  
4  CONDITION_ZONEID  Player must be in a certain zone  
5  CONDITION_REPUTATION_RANK  Player must have a certain reputation rank with a certain faction  
6  CONDITION_TEAM  Player must be part of the specified team (Alliance or Horde)  
7  CONDITION_SKILL  Player must have a certain skill value  
8  CONDITION_QUESTREWARDED  Player must have completed a quest first  
9  CONDITION_QUESTTAKEN  Players must have the quest in the quest log and not completed yet  
10  CONDITION_AD_COMMISSION_AURA   
11  CONDITION_NO_AURA  Player looting must have no aura active mentioned in condition_value1  
12  CONDITION_ACTIVE_EVENT  The loot with that condition can be looted only while the Event (condition_value1) is active  

NOTE: For reference entries this field has no meaning, not used by the core in any way and should have the default value of 0. 

condition_value
The values in the condition_value1 and condition_value2 fields depend on what condition was put in lootcondition. 

¦CONDITION_AURA 
¦condition_value1: The spell ID from where the aura came from. 
¦condition_value2: The effect index of the spell that applied the aura (0, 1, or 2) 
¦CONDITION_ITEM 
¦condition_value1: Item ID 
¦condition_value2: Count 
¦CONDITION_ITEM_EQUIPPED 
¦condition_value1: Item ID 
¦condition_value2: Always 0 
¦CONDITION_ZONEID 
¦condition_value1: Zone ID 
¦condition_value2: Always 0 
¦CONDITION_REPUTATION_RANK 
¦condition_value1: Faction ID 
¦condition_value2: Minimum rank 
¦CONDITION_TEAM 
¦condition_value1: Player team (469 - Alliance, 67 - Horde) 
¦condition_value2: Always 0 
¦CONDITION_SKILL 
¦condition_value1: Skill ID (SkillLine.dbc) 
¦condition_value2: Skill value needed 
¦CONDITION_QUESTREWARDED 
¦condition_value1: Quest ID 
¦condition_value2: Always 0 
¦CONDITION_QUESTTAKEN 
¦condition_value1: Quest ID 
¦condition_value2: Always 0 
¦CONDITION_NO_AURA 
¦condition_value1: The spell ID of the aura which have to be not active. 
¦condition_value2: The effect index of the spell that applied the aura (0, 1, or 2) 
¦CONDITION_ACTIVE_EVENT 
¦condition_value1: Event ID 

NOTE: For reference entries these fields have no meaning, not used by the core in any way and should have the default value of 0. 

Agreements
These agreements are different for different loot tables. Mainly agreements defines rules for loot template IDs (entry) and groups 

Fishing haul
For fishing_loot_template, ID is the zone or area ID from AreaTable.dbc (Note: Area IDs are not included in the link) 

Also an extra note on fishing_loot_template: if just one area ID is defined for a zone, then that whole zone ID is skipped and therefore all areas in that zone need to have entries in the table. Only when there doesn't exist any area entries for a zone does the core use the zone ID directly. Zone = Wetlands, Elwynn, etc; Area = Northshire, Lakeshire, etc. 

When several zones uses the same loot definition then 

¦the loot template of the zone with minimal ID (minID) should be defined without references 
¦the other zone with the same loot should have loot definition as a single reference to the minID loot definition 
Note: To be confirmed by UDB developers 

As successful fishing should give exactly 1 fish (with an exception for quest fishes) so non-quest part of every loot template should be 

¦or single plain entry with 100% drop chance 
¦or a single group with group chance equal to 100% 
¦or a reference to a template made according to previous two variants. It is recommended to use group references. 
When a fish is catched for a quest it becoms the second fish on the hook. Many people rolled on floor laughing but this is blizzlike and fortunately easy to implement. Just add necessary quest drop definition(s). 

Corpse loot
For creature_loot_template basic approach is to use creature_template.lootid equal to creature_template.entry. But this results in great overhead in the loot table as 

¦many creatures use the same loot definition (well, stats on sites are similar due to the nature of random roll) 
¦even more creatures use same parts of loot definition 
That is why it is recommended to use grouping, group references and template references. 

Disenchant outcome
Agreements for disenchant loot templates numbering is item.level*100 + item.quality where item is disenchanting target. 

As disenchanting should give exactly 1 type of shard/essence/dust/etc so every loot template should be 

¦or single plain entry with 100% drop chance 
¦or a single group with group chance equal to 100% 
There is no use for references here as the reference is done with the relation field. No quest drop at all. 

Gameobject harvest
TBD 

Luggage contents
TBD 

Pocket pick-ups
Agreements for pickpocketing loot templates numbering is not known. 

TBD 

Prospecting outcome
Agreements for prospecting loot templates numbering is not known. 

TBD 

Skinning pulls
Agreements for skinning loot templates numbering is not known. It's a real pity as many creatures should use the same templates. In most cases mobs with the same family and level have very similar skinning statistics. 

As skinning should give exactly 1 type of skin/hide/etc so every loot template should be 

¦or single plain entry with 100% drop chance 
¦or single group with group chance equal to 100% 
There is no use for references here as the reference is done with the relation field. 

When a skin is pulled for a quest it becoms the second skin from the mob. Yes, funny. This is blizzlike and fortunately easy to implement. Just add necessary quest drop definition(s). 

Examples
The example here mainly taken from current UDB (339) or from UDB forum. Often examples have several authors and it is uneasy to credit right people so: many thanks to ALL UDB devs and conributors. 

But please note that some (or even all) example may contain incorrect data and are shown just for demostration of different loot data organisation. 

Simple examples
Gameobject dropping a single non-quest item
# gameobject_template: entry=1622 name='Bruiseweed' type=3 data1=1419

DELETE gameobject_loot_template WHERE entry=1419;
INSERT INTO gameobject_loot_template
  (entry, item, ChanceOrRef, QuestChanceOrGroup, mincount, maxcount, freeforall, lootcondition, condition_value1, condition_value2)
VALUES
  (1419, 2453, 100, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0);  # 100% drop a pile of 1 to 3 items [2453] 'Bruiseweed'
Taking into account default values of the table the second query could be simplified with no change of data (`mincount` is left on cosmetic reasons as `maxcount` has a non-default value): 

gameobject_template: entry=1622 name='Bruiseweed' type=3 data1=1419

INSERT INTO gameobject_loot_template
  (entry, item, ChanceOrRef, mincount, maxcount)
VALUES
  (1419, 2453, 100, 1, 3);  # 100% drop a pile of 1 to 3 items [2453] 'Bruiseweed'
Creature having in the pocket single quest item
# creature_template: entry=6846, name='Defias Dockmaster', pickpocketloot=6846
# Note: link with pickpocketing_loot_template is on `pickpocketloot` field (which is equal to `entry` field in this case)

DELETE pickpocketing_loot_template WHERE entry=6846;

INSERT INTO pickpocketing_loot_template
  (entry, item, ChanceOrRef, QuestChanceOrGroup, mincount, maxcount, freeforall, lootcondition, condition_value1, condition_value2)
VALUES
  (6846, 7675, 0, 100, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);
Again, taking into account default values of the table the second query could be simplified with no change of data: 

INSERT INTO pickpocketing_loot_template
  (entry, item, ChanceOrRef, QuestChanceOrGroup)
VALUES
  (6846, 7675, 0, 100);
Note that ChanceOrRef can not be skipped as it has default value of 100. 

Wrong definition: combined quest and non-quest chances
SELECT * FROM `pickpocketing_loot_template` WHERE `entry` = '20424';
entry  item  ChanceOrRef  QuestChanceOrGroup  mincount  maxcount  freeforall  lootcondition  condition_value1  condition_value2  
20424  422  0.1  100  1  1  0  0  0  0  
20424  929  0.1  100  1  1  0  0  0  0  
20424  4538  0.1  100  1  1  0  0  0  0  
20424  4542  0.1  100  1  1  0  0  0  0  
20424  5374  0.1  100  1  1  0  0  0  0  
20424  16882  22.2222  0  1  1  0  0  0  0  

First 5 rows in the result are incorrect, ChanceOrRef and QuestChanceOrGroup should not be positive simultanously. See allowed combinations. The core does not crash encounering that, but non-quest chances are ignored. 

Groups
Simple skinning group
SELECT * FROM `skinning_loot_template` WHERE `entry` = '100003';
gives 

entry  item  ChanceOrRef  QuestChanceOrGroup  mincount  maxcount  freeforall  lootcondition  condition_value1  condition_value2  
100003  8170  80  -1  1  1  0  0  0  0  
100003  8171  20  -1  1  1  0  0  0  0  

Quite correct. Used quite widely: 

SELECT entry FROM `creature_template` WHERE `skinloot` = '100003';
gives 

659 2707 4242 4243 5347 5440 6582 6583 6648 7376 8024 8025 8204 8302 8303 8925 8932 9032 9297
9521 9526 9527 10177 10204 10376 10596 10619 10717 10942 10979 10988 11181 11374 11671 11672
11710 11740 11741 11885 11896 11897 11956 12124 12125 12803 13160 13178 13221 13618 13676 13916
14283 14344 14476 14477 14566 14568 14732 14884 14943 14944 14945 14946 14947 14948 14965 14986
14988 15041 15114 15172 15204 15220 15316 15338 15718
Almost correct skinning loot
SELECT * FROM `skinning_loot_template` WHERE `entry` = '5292';
gives 

entry  item  ChanceOrRef  QuestChanceOrGroup  mincount  maxcount  freeforall  lootcondition  condition_value1  condition_value2  
5292  4304  49.655  -1  1  1  0  0  0  0  
5292  4234  43.1624  -1  1  1  0  0  0  0  
5292  8169  4.0984  -1  1  1  0  0  0  0  
5292  4235  3.0676  -1  1  1  0  0  0  0  
5292  8973  0  80  1  1  0  0  0  0  

Quest entry and a group. Would be good if group chance was 100, but it is only 99.9834. So on average at 166 skinning attempts over 1000 000 player will get an empty loot window (withuot considering quest skins which are very rare). 

Used for creadure with entry=5292 only. 

Damnly wrong skinning loot
SELECT * FROM `skinning_loot_template` WHERE `entry` = '10151';
gives 

entry  item  ChanceOrRef  QuestChanceOrGroup  mincount  maxcount  freeforall  lootcondition  condition_value1  condition_value2  
10151  8154  60  -1  1  1  0  0  0  0  
10151  8170  48  -1  1  2  0  0  0  0  
10151  4304  40  -1  1  2  0  0  0  0  
10151  8368  5  -1  1  1  0  0  0  0  
10151  8171  4  -1  1  1  0  0  0  0  
10151  8169  3  -1  1  1  0  0  0  0  

SELECT entry, name FROM `creature_template` WHERE `skinloot` = '10151';
gives 

entry  name  
11614  Bloodshot  

First problem the group chance is 160 that is much higher than 100. If by a case order of records in core (actually it is unknown) is such that chances of 60 and 40 are in the beginning then the rest of the group will never be processed. The result will be exacly the same is if the loot template was 

entry  item  ChanceOrRef  QuestChanceOrGroup  mincount  maxcount  freeforall  lootcondition  condition_value1  condition_value2  
10151  8154  60  -1  1  1  0  0  0  0  
10151  4304  40  -1  1  2  0  0  0  0  

Moreover, skinloot in not equal to creature_template.entry and this is NOT a reference to the same loot - 10151 is used ONLY by creature 11614. And the last problem - wowhead has no data about this skinning loot of this pet at all...

QuestFlags
This flag field defines more specifically the type of quest it is. Aside from the daily flag and sharable flag, this field is used just for grouping purposes and NOT for any other quest requirements. The quest requirements are calculated from non-zero values in other quest template fields. Also, while some of these flags are known, others have yet an unknown purpose and the comments below is simply guesswork on them. 

At the moment (rev 6055), the core does not actually handle these flags any differently (again, except for the daily flag and the sharable flag). 

Bit  Name  Comments  
0  QUEST_FLAGS_NONE  No flags, so no groups assigned to this quest.  
1  QUEST_FLAGS_STAY_ALIVE  If the player dies, the quest is failed. (?)  
2  QUEST_FLAGS_EVENT  Escort quests or any other event-driven quests. If player in party, all players that can accept this quest will receive confirmation box to accept quest.  
4  QUEST_FLAGS_EXPLORATION  Involves the activation of an areatrigger.  
8  QUEST_FLAGS_SHARABLE  Allows the quest to be shared with other players.  
16  QUEST_FLAGS_NONE2  Unknown at this time and not used.  
32  QUEST_FLAGS_EPIC  Epic class quests (hunter) (??)  
64  QUEST_FLAGS_RAID  Raid or similar player group needed for quest.  
128  QUEST_FLAGS_TBC  Added with or after TBC.  
256  QUEST_FLAGS_UNK2  Quest needs extra non-objective items dropped (eg. ReqSourceID fields) (?)  
512  QUEST_FLAGS_HIDDEN_REWARDS  Item and monetary rewards are hidden in the initial quest details page and in the quest log but will appear once ready to be rewarded.  
1024  QUEST_FLAGS_AUTO_REWARDED  These quests are automatically rewarded on quest complete and they will never appear in quest log client side.  
2048  QUEST_FLAGS_TBC_RACES  Blood elf/draenei starting zone quests.  
4096  QUEST_FLAGS_DAILY  Daily repeatable quests (only flag that the core applies specific behavior for)  
8192  QUEST_FLAGS_UNK5  Grizzly Hills PvP daily? Once quest is accepted the player's PvP is enabled.  

Like all flag based fields, QuestFlags can be added for the different types of quest. 

SpecialFlags
This field is a bitmask and controls only two extra requirements and has only 4 possible values. 

¦0: No extra requirements 
¦1: Makes the quest repeatable. 
¦2: Makes the quest only completable by some external event (an entry in areatrigger_involvedrelation, spell effect quest complete or an entry in spell_scripts with command 7 as some examples) 
¦3: Both repeatable and completable only through an external event 
CharTitleId
The title the character will receive upon completion of the quest. See CharTitles.dbc 

PlayersSlain
BonusTalents
PrevQuestId
if value > 0: Contains the previous quest id, that must be completed before this quest can be started. 

If value < 0: Contains the parent quest id, that must be active before this quest can be started. 

See the examples section for examples. 

NextQuestId
If value > 0: Contains the next quest id, if PrevQuestId of that quest is not sufficient. 

If value < 0: Contains the sub quest id, if PrevQuestId of that quest is not sufficient. If quest have many alternative next quests (class specific quests lead from single not class specific quest) field PrevQuestId in next quests can used for setting this dependence. 

See the examples section for examples. 

ExclusiveGroup
if ExclusiveGroup > 0 

Allows to define a group of quests of which only one may be chosen and completed. E.g. if from quests 1200, 1201 and 1202 only one should be allowed to be chosen, insert 1200 into ExclusiveGroup of all 3 quests. 

if ExclusiveGroup < 0 

Allows to define a group of quests of which all must be completed and rewarded to start next quest. E.g. if quest 1000 dependent from one of quests 1200, 1201 and 1202 and all this quests have same negative exclusive group then all this quest must be completed and rewarded before quest 1000 can be started. 

See the examples section for examples. 

NextQuestInChain

See the examples section for examples. 

SrcItemId
Item's ID given by the quest giver at beginning of the quest. Items will be deleted when quest is abandoned. 

SrcItemCount
Amount of items given. 

SrcSpell

Objectives
Objectives of the quest. If empty, quest is an auto-complete quest that can be immediately finished without accepting it first. 

OfferRewardText
First text send to the player by the NPC when completing the quest. You can use certain placeholders that will be filled in in-game: $B - line break, $N - name, $R - race, $C - class, $Gmale:female; (male and female can be replace with any synonymn you want, but the order must stay the same. IE: boy:girl / man:woman / sir:madam / dude:chick) 

RequestItemsText
Text sent to player when the player tries to talk to the NPC with the quest active but incomplete. (The text under the "Progress" title in Wowhead.) You can use certain placeholders that will be filled in in-game: $B - line break, $N - name, $R - race, $C - class, $Gmale:female; (male and female can be replace with any synonymn you want, but the order must stay the same. IE: boy:girl / man:woman / sir:madam / dude:chick) 

EndText

ReqItemId
Item_template Id of required item to complete the quest. 

ReqItemCount
Amount of required items 

ReqSourceID
Item ID that is needed indirectly by the quest. For example, the quests asks for item X but the only way to get item X is by activating item Y; however, item Y is also a quest item. Therefore you set item Y's ID in this field. This requirement will not appear in the quest text, it is just for the core to know when to drop a quest item that isn't in the ReqItemID field but is still needed by the quest. 

ReqSourceCount
The maximum number of copies of the item in ReqSourceID that can be picked up (and dropped by the core). Having ReqSourceId !=0 and ReqSourceCount for that = 0, there is no limit for the items to drop. 

ReqCreatureOrGOId
Value > 0: required creature_template ID the player needs to kill/cast on in order to complete the quest. 

Value < 0: required gameobject_template ID the player needs to cast on in order to complete the quest. 

If ReqSpellCast is != 0, the objective is to cast on target, else kill. 

NOTE: If ReqSpellCast is != 0 and the spell has effects Send Event or Quest Complete, this field may be left empty. 

ReqCreatureOrGOCount
The number of times the creature or gameobject must be killed or casted upon. 

ReqSpellCast
Spell ID of Spell that needs to be cast in order to fulfill a quest objective. A spell normally needs a target which is ReqCreatureOrGOId 

And for spells with "SpellEffect with ImpliciteTargetA-B == 38" check table Spell_script_target 

NOTE: If the spell has spell effects Send Event or Quest Complete, it can be entered here WITHOUT the need for a target and count. 

RewChoiceItemId, RewChoiceItemCount
Id of item available for reward choice. 

Number of Charges in rewarded item available. 




RewItemId, RewItemCount
Number of RewItem 

item Id given for reward (no choice). 

RewRepFaction, RewRepValue
Faction Id (from Faction.dbc) for which the quest give reputation points. 

Number of gain or lost reputation points for Faction at quest completion. This is special reputation rewarding. Normal reputation reward to quest rewarding creature faction calculated and added automatically. 

RewHonorableKills
Number of honorable kill honor rewarded for completing this quest. 

Example: An example value is 15 for quest 8388: At level 70 an honorable kill is 20.9 honor worth. Multiply this with 15 and you receive 313.5, after the multiplication the value is rounded up. So the honor rewarded at level 70 is 314 for this quest. 

RewOrReqMoney
Money earned by completing the quest (if value > 0). Money quest requirement (if value < 0). 

RewMoneyMaxLevel
The money a character at level 70 would get when they complete this quest. This field also controls the XP given as the XP is calculated from the value in this field by the following formula. If the quest is repeatable, XP will be given only once. The total XP that a character will receive is also affected by the level difference between the character's level and the quest's level. 

The formula for calculating XP from the value in this field:
QuestLevel >= 65: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 6.0
QuestLevel == 64: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 4.8
QuestLevel == 63: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 3.6
QuestLevel == 62: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 2.4
QuestLevel == 61: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 1.2
QuestLevel <= 60: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 0.6 

RewSpell
Spell that is shown to be casted on quest completion in the quest log. Note that this spell will NOT be casted if RewSpellCast is non-zero. The spell in the other field will be casted instead, in which case the spell here only serves as the visual in the quest log. 

NOTE: This field comes straight from the WDB and should not be changed. 

RewSpellCast
Spell that will always be casted at player when completing the quest. This can be learn spell and player learned some spell in result, or buff spell, for example. If this field is non-zero then this spell will ALWAYS be casted and the spell in RewSpell will not. 

NOTE: This field comes straight from the WDB and should not be changed. 

RewMailTemplateId
If the quest gives as a reward an item from a possible list of items, the ID here corresponds to the proper loot template in quest_mail_loot_template. According to the rules in that loot template, items "looted" will be sent by mail at the completion of the quest. 

RewMailDelaySecs
How many seconds to wait until the mail is sent to the character that turned in a quest rewarding items from a loot template defined in RewMailTemplateId 

PointMapId
MapId of a quest point of interest (POI - Point Of Interest). POI will be shown on the map when quest is active. 

PointX
X coordinate of quest POI. 

PointY
Y coordinate of quest POI. 

PointOpt
DetailsEmote
CompleteEmote
Emote played by the related NPC at the time all quest objects are completed. 

OfferRewardEmote
Emote played by the NPC at the time the character is rewarded for the quest. 

StartScript
ID of the start script. See quest_start_scripts.id 

CompleteScript
ID of the end script. See quest_end_scripts.id 

Examples
The "rules of engagement" dealing with quests 

1. Always use PrevQuestId before using NextQuestId. NextQuestId is considered optional and to be used only when PrevQuestId is not sufficient 


Basic quest 

Single, stand-alone quest with no prerequisites 

    *questA*
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = 0        entry = questA
When this quest require another quest to be rewarded 

    *questA*
PrevQuestId = questX   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = 0        entry = questA
Chain of quests 

Player get quests in a strict chain that must be completed in a specific order. 

    *questA*
        |
    *questB*
        |
    *questC*
        |
    *questD*
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = questB    entry = questA
PrevQuestId = questA   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = questC    entry = questB
PrevQuestId = questB   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questC
PrevQuestId = questC   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questD
Chain of quests with multiple start quests. 

Player should only be allowed to complete one of three possible 

    *questA*     *questB*    *questC*
        \           |           /
          ------ *questD* -----
                    |
                 *questE*
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = questD   ExclusiveGroup = questA   NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questA
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = questD   ExclusiveGroup = questA   NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questB
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = questD   ExclusiveGroup = questA   NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questC
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = questE    entry = questD
PrevQuestId = questD   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0        NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questE

Chain of quests with multiple start quests. 

Player must complete all three initial quests before D becomes available 

    *questA*    *questB*    *questC*
        \          |          /
         ------ *questD* -----
                   |
                *questE*
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = questD   ExclusiveGroup = -questA    NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questA
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = questD   ExclusiveGroup = -questA    NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questB
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = questD   ExclusiveGroup = -questA    NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questC
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = questE    entry = questD
PrevQuestId = questD   NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questE

Quests with split and a child quest 

Completing A unlocks B and C that can be done at the same time. They both need to be completed before D becomes available. X is needed to obtain item for C and this quest should only be available if C is active 

                *questA*
                /        \
           *questB     *questC* - *questX*
                \        /
                *questD*
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0         NextQuestInChain = 0        entry = questA
PrevQuestId = questA   NextQuestId = questD   ExclusiveGroup = -questB   NextQuestInChain = 0        entry = questB
PrevQuestId = questA   NextQuestId = questD   ExclusiveGroup = -questB   NextQuestInChain = 0        entry = questC
PrevQuestId = -questC  NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0         NextQuestInChain = 0        entry = questX
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0         NextQuestInChain = 0        entry = questD

Multiple quest chains, leading to one final quest 

Player may complete (not required to) X, but has to complete all three quest chains before final quest becomes available 

                *questX*
                   |
    *questA*    *questC*    *questE*
       |           |            |
    *questB*    *questD*    *questF*
       \           |           /
         ------ *questG* -----
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = questC    entry = questX

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = questB    entry = questA
PrevQuestId = questA   NextQuestId = questG    ExclusiveGroup = -questB    NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questB
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = questD    entry = questC
PrevQuestId = questC   NextQuestId = questG    ExclusiveGroup = -questB    NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questD
PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = questF    entry = questE
PrevQuestId = questE   NextQuestId = questG    ExclusiveGroup = -questB    NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questF

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questG

Complicated 

Player must first complete A, then B to unlock the chain from C to E. Three other quests in a group will also be unlocked, those can be done at the same time. The three grouped quests must all be completed before I becomes available. Completion of E and I is required to obtain the final quest. 

                *questA*

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questJ

Impossible - many quests may unlock many 

Player can choose between two alternative chains (Chain A or B, but not both chains). A2 or B2 should unlock C, D and E when complete. When all three complete, F should be unlocked. If player get A3 or B3 after complete F, depends on if chain A or B was chosen. 

                *questA1*           *questB1*
                    |                   |

PrevQuestId = questF   NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questA3
PrevQuestId = questF   NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questB3
Note: if player can choose between chain A or B may be determined by faction status (aldor or scryer), using ReqMinRepFaction = 1. Player should not be able to be neutral+1 with both at the same time. This may be the common threshold to obtain aldor or scryer quests (this is unsure). If that is the case, only the unlock of C, D and E after complete A2 _or_ B2 is the impossible part.

Npc gossip
From UDB
The `npc_gossip` table 

This table is the link between NPCs and gossip text. When you click on an NPC that says something more than just "Greetings $N", this is the table that links that NPC to the text. 

Structure

npc_guid  int(11) unsigned  NO  PRI  0   
textid  int(11) unsigned  NO   0   


Description of the fields 

npc_guid
You place the GUID from creature.guid in this field for the NPC that you want to have gossip. 

textid
This is the ID from npc_text.ID of the text that you want the NPC to say. 


Now, to get your NPC to actually say something, you need to update creature_template.npcflag with the gossip flag, which is 1.

Npc spellclick spells
From UDB
The `npc_spellclick_spells` table 

This table holds information about spells to be casted upon receiving CMSG_SPELLCLICK. That opcode is sent for quests in which you have to loot creatures, who are already dead at spawning. Examples are Planning for the Future and Rifle the bodies. 

Structure 

Field  Type  Null  Key  Default  Extra

cast_flags  tinyint(3) unsigned  NO     

Description of the fields 

npc_entry
Reference to Creature_template#entry 

spell_id
The spell which should be casted. 

Note that for several quests there are more than one spell per click. Planing for the Future for example has Planning for the Future: Create Snowfall Glade Pup which will create the item in the player's inventory and Planning for the Future: Create Snowfall Glade Pup Cover which despawns the creature. 

This creates the illusion that the creature has been looted. 

quest_start
Same as Spell_area#quest_start. 

quest_start_active
Same as Spell_area#quest_start_active. 

quest_end
Same as Spell_area#quest_end. 

cast_flags
On every spellclick event a player and a creature "participate". This field defines who casts the spell on who. 

Lower bit defines caster: 1=player, 0=creature; higher bit defines target, same mapping as caster bit. 

You can use that table for the actual value: 

Target  Caster  cast_flags value  
Creature  Creature  0  
Creature  Player  1  
Player  Creature  2  
Player  Player  3

QuestFlags
This flag field defines more specifically the type of quest it is. Aside from the daily flag and sharable flag, this field is used just for grouping purposes and NOT for any other quest requirements. The quest requirements are calculated from non-zero values in other quest template fields. Also, while some of these flags are known, others have yet an unknown purpose and the comments below is simply guesswork on them. 

At the moment (rev 6055), the core does not actually handle these flags any differently (again, except for the daily flag and the sharable flag). 

Bit  Name  Comments  
0  QUEST_FLAGS_NONE  No flags, so no groups assigned to this quest.  
1  QUEST_FLAGS_STAY_ALIVE  If the player dies, the quest is failed. (?)  
2  QUEST_FLAGS_EVENT  Escort quests or any other event-driven quests. If player in party, all players that can accept this quest will receive confirmation box to accept quest.  
4  QUEST_FLAGS_EXPLORATION  Involves the activation of an areatrigger.  
8  QUEST_FLAGS_SHARABLE  Allows the quest to be shared with other players.  
16  QUEST_FLAGS_NONE2  Unknown at this time and not used.  
32  QUEST_FLAGS_EPIC  Epic class quests (hunter) (??)  
64  QUEST_FLAGS_RAID  Raid or similar player group needed for quest.  
128  QUEST_FLAGS_TBC  Added with or after TBC.  
256  QUEST_FLAGS_UNK2  Quest needs extra non-objective items dropped (eg. ReqSourceID fields) (?)  
512  QUEST_FLAGS_HIDDEN_REWARDS  Item and monetary rewards are hidden in the initial quest details page and in the quest log but will appear once ready to be rewarded.  
1024  QUEST_FLAGS_AUTO_REWARDED  These quests are automatically rewarded on quest complete and they will never appear in quest log client side.  
2048  QUEST_FLAGS_TBC_RACES  Blood elf/draenei starting zone quests.  
4096  QUEST_FLAGS_DAILY  Daily repeatable quests (only flag that the core applies specific behavior for)  
8192  QUEST_FLAGS_UNK5  Grizzly Hills PvP daily? Once quest is accepted the player's PvP is enabled.  

Like all flag based fields, QuestFlags can be added for the different types of quest. 

SpecialFlags
This field is a bitmask and controls only two extra requirements and has only 4 possible values. 

¦0: No extra requirements 
¦1: Makes the quest repeatable. 
¦2: Makes the quest only completable by some external event (an entry in areatrigger_involvedrelation, spell effect quest complete or an entry in spell_scripts with command 7 as some examples)

PlayersSlain
BonusTalents
PrevQuestId
if value > 0: Contains the previous quest id, that must be completed before this quest can be started. 

If value < 0: Contains the parent quest id, that must be active before this quest can be started. 

See the examples section for examples. 

NextQuestId
If value > 0: Contains the next quest id, if PrevQuestId of that quest is not sufficient.

ExclusiveGroup
if ExclusiveGroup > 0 

Allows to define a group of quests of which only one may be chosen and completed. E.g. if from quests 1200, 1201 and 1202 only one should be allowed to be chosen, insert 1200 into ExclusiveGroup of all 3 quests. 

if ExclusiveGroup < 0 

Allows to define a group of quests of which all must be completed and rewarded to start next quest. E.g. if quest 1000 dependent from one of quests 1200, 1201 and 1202 and all this quests have same negative exclusive group then all this quest must be completed and rewarded before quest 1000 can be started. 

See the examples section for examples.

ReqItemId
Item_template Id of required item to complete the quest. 

ReqItemCount
Amount of required items 

ReqSourceID
Item ID that is needed indirectly by the quest. For example, the quests asks for item X but the only way to get item X is by activating item Y; however, item Y is also a quest item. Therefore you set item Y's ID in this field. This requirement will not appear in the quest text, it is just for the core to know when to drop a quest item that isn't in the ReqItemID field but is still needed by the quest. 

ReqSourceCount
The maximum number of copies of the item in ReqSourceID that can be picked up (and dropped by the core). Having ReqSourceId !=0 and ReqSourceCount for that = 0, there is no limit for the items to drop. 

ReqCreatureOrGOId
Value > 0: required creature_template ID the player needs to kill/cast on in order to complete the quest. 

Value < 0: required gameobject_template ID the player needs to cast on in order to complete the quest.

ReqSpellCast
Spell ID of Spell that needs to be cast in order to fulfill a quest objective. A spell normally needs a target which is ReqCreatureOrGOId 

And for spells with "SpellEffect with ImpliciteTargetA-B == 38" check table Spell_script_target 

NOTE: If the spell has spell effects Send Event or Quest Complete, it can be entered here WITHOUT the need for a target and count. 

RewChoiceItemId, RewChoiceItemCount
Id of item available for reward choice. 

Number of Charges in rewarded item available. 




RewItemId, RewItemCount
Number of RewItem 

item Id given for reward (no choice). 

RewRepFaction, RewRepValue
Faction Id (from Faction.dbc) for which the quest give reputation points. 

Number of gain or lost reputation points for Faction at quest completion. This is special reputation rewarding. Normal reputation reward to quest rewarding creature faction calculated and added automatically. 

RewHonorableKills
Number of honorable kill honor rewarded for completing this quest. 

Example: An example value is 15 for quest 8388: At level 70 an honorable kill is 20.9 honor worth. Multiply this with 15 and you receive 313.5, after the multiplication the value is rounded up. So the honor rewarded at level 70 is 314 for this quest. 

RewOrReqMoney
Money earned by completing the quest (if value > 0). Money quest requirement (if value < 0). 

RewMoneyMaxLevel
The money a character at level 70 would get when they complete this quest. This field also controls the XP given as the XP is calculated from the value in this field by the following formula. If the quest is repeatable, XP will be given only once. The total XP that a character will receive is also affected by the level difference between the character's level and the quest's level. 

The formula for calculating XP from the value in this field:
QuestLevel >= 65: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 6.0
QuestLevel == 64: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 4.8
QuestLevel == 63: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 3.6
QuestLevel == 62: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 2.4
QuestLevel == 61: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 1.2
QuestLevel <= 60: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 0.6 

RewSpell
Spell that is shown to be casted on quest completion in the quest log. Note that this spell will NOT be casted if RewSpellCast is non-zero. The spell in the other field will be casted instead, in which case the spell here only serves as the visual in the quest log. 

NOTE: This field comes straight from the WDB and should not be changed. 

RewSpellCast
Spell that will always be casted at player when completing the quest. This can be learn spell and player learned some spell in result, or buff spell, for example. If this field is non-zero then this spell will ALWAYS be casted and the spell in RewSpell will not. 

NOTE: This field comes straight from the WDB and should not be changed. 

RewMailTemplateId
If the quest gives as a reward an item from a possible list of items, the ID here corresponds to the proper loot template in quest_mail_loot_template. According to the rules in that loot template, items "looted" will be sent by mail at the completion of the quest. 

RewMailDelaySecs
How many seconds to wait until the mail is sent to the character that turned in a quest rewarding items from a loot template defined in RewMailTemplateId 

PointMapId

Note: if player can choose between chain A or B may be determined by faction status (aldor or scryer), using ReqMinRepFaction = 1. Player should not be able to be neutral+1 with both at the same time. This may be the common threshold to obtain aldor or scryer quests (this is unsure). If that is the case, only the unlock of C, D and E after complete A2 _or_ B2 is the impossible part.

QuestFlags
This flag field defines more specifically the type of quest it is. Aside from the daily flag and sharable flag, this field is used just for grouping purposes and NOT for any other quest requirements. The quest requirements are calculated from non-zero values in other quest template fields. Also, while some of these flags are known, others have yet an unknown purpose and the comments below is simply guesswork on them. 

At the moment (rev 6055), the core does not actually handle these flags any differently (again, except for the daily flag and the sharable flag). 

Bit  Name  Comments  
0  QUEST_FLAGS_NONE  No flags, so no groups assigned to this quest.  
1  QUEST_FLAGS_STAY_ALIVE  If the player dies, the quest is failed. (?)  
2  QUEST_FLAGS_EVENT  Escort quests or any other event-driven quests. If player in party, all players that can accept this quest will receive confirmation box to accept quest.  
4  QUEST_FLAGS_EXPLORATION  Involves the activation of an areatrigger.  
8  QUEST_FLAGS_SHARABLE  Allows the quest to be shared with other players.  
16  QUEST_FLAGS_NONE2  Unknown at this time and not used.  
32  QUEST_FLAGS_EPIC  Epic class quests (hunter) (??)  
64  QUEST_FLAGS_RAID  Raid or similar player group needed for quest.  
128  QUEST_FLAGS_TBC  Added with or after TBC.  
256  QUEST_FLAGS_UNK2  Quest needs extra non-objective items dropped (eg. ReqSourceID fields) (?)  
512  QUEST_FLAGS_HIDDEN_REWARDS  Item and monetary rewards are hidden in the initial quest details page and in the quest log but will appear once ready to be rewarded.  
1024  QUEST_FLAGS_AUTO_REWARDED  These quests are automatically rewarded on quest complete and they will never appear in quest log client side.  
2048  QUEST_FLAGS_TBC_RACES  Blood elf/draenei starting zone quests.  
4096  QUEST_FLAGS_DAILY  Daily repeatable quests (only flag that the core applies specific behavior for)  
8192  QUEST_FLAGS_UNK5  Grizzly Hills PvP daily? Once quest is accepted the player's PvP is enabled.  

Like all flag based fields, QuestFlags can be added for the different types of quest. 

SpecialFlags
This field is a bitmask and controls only two extra requirements and has only 4 possible values. 

¦0: No extra requirements 
¦1: Makes the quest repeatable. 
¦2: Makes the quest only completable by some external event (an entry in areatrigger_involvedrelation, spell effect quest complete or an entry in spell_scripts with command 7 as some examples) 
¦3: Both repeatable and completable only through an external event 
CharTitleId

PlayersSlain
BonusTalents
PrevQuestId
if value > 0: Contains the previous quest id, that must be completed before this quest can be started. 

If value < 0: Contains the parent quest id, that must be active before this quest can be started. 

See the examples section for examples. 

NextQuestId
If value > 0: Contains the next quest id, if PrevQuestId of that quest is not sufficient. 

If value < 0: Contains the sub quest id, if PrevQuestId of that quest is not sufficient. If quest have many alternative next quests (class specific quests lead from single not class specific quest) field PrevQuestId in next quests can used for setting this dependence. 

See the examples section for examples. 

ExclusiveGroup
if ExclusiveGroup > 0 

Allows to define a group of quests of which only one may be chosen and completed. E.g. if from quests 1200, 1201 and 1202 only one should be allowed to be chosen, insert 1200 into ExclusiveGroup of all 3 quests. 

if ExclusiveGroup < 0 

Allows to define a group of quests of which all must be completed and rewarded to start next quest. E.g. if quest 1000 dependent from one of quests 1200, 1201 and 1202 and all this quests have same negative exclusive group then all this quest must be completed and rewarded before quest 1000 can be started. 

See the examples section for examples. 

NextQuestInChain

Objectives
Objectives of the quest. If empty, quest is an auto-complete quest that can be immediately finished without accepting it first. 

OfferRewardText

You can use certain placeholders that will be filled in in-game: $B - line break, $N - name, $R - race, $C - class, $Gmale:female; (male and female can be replace with any synonymn you want, but the order must stay the same. IE: boy:girl / man:woman / sir:madam / dude:chick) 

RequestItemsText

You can use certain placeholders that will be filled in in-game: $B - line break, $N - name, $R - race, $C - class, $Gmale:female; (male and female can be replace with any synonymn you want, but the order must stay the same. IE: boy:girl / man:woman / sir:madam / dude:chick) 

EndText
Used only when SpecialFlags 2 is active. This is the objective text sent to the player describing the external event that is required to complete the quest. 

ObjectiveText
Used to define non-standard objective texts, that show up in the questlog. Example, "Heal fallen warrior" and the number gets added by Count values. 

ReqItemId
Item_template Id of required item to complete the quest. 

ReqItemCount
Amount of required items 

ReqSourceID
Item ID that is needed indirectly by the quest. For example, the quests asks for item X but the only way to get item X is by activating item Y; however, item Y is also a quest item. Therefore you set item Y's ID in this field. This requirement will not appear in the quest text, it is just for the core to know when to drop a quest item that isn't in the ReqItemID field but is still needed by the quest. 

ReqSourceCount
The maximum number of copies of the item in ReqSourceID that can be picked up (and dropped by the core). Having ReqSourceId !=0 and ReqSourceCount for that = 0, there is no limit for the items to drop. 

ReqCreatureOrGOId
Value > 0: required creature_template ID the player needs to kill/cast on in order to complete the quest. 

Value < 0: required gameobject_template ID the player needs to cast on in order to complete the quest. 

If ReqSpellCast is != 0, the objective is to cast on target, else kill. 

NOTE: If ReqSpellCast is != 0 and the spell has effects Send Event or Quest Complete, this field may be left empty. 

ReqCreatureOrGOCount
The number of times the creature or gameobject must be killed or casted upon. 

ReqSpellCast
Spell ID of Spell that needs to be cast in order to fulfill a quest objective. A spell normally needs a target which is ReqCreatureOrGOId 

And for spells with "SpellEffect with ImpliciteTargetA-B == 38" check table Spell_script_target 

NOTE: If the spell has spell effects Send Event or Quest Complete, it can be entered here WITHOUT the need for a target and count. 

RewChoiceItemId, RewChoiceItemCount
Id of item available for reward choice. 

Number of Charges in rewarded item available. 




RewItemId, RewItemCount
Number of RewItem 

item Id given for reward (no choice). 

RewRepFaction, RewRepValue
Faction Id (from Faction.dbc) for which the quest give reputation points. 

Number of gain or lost reputation points for Faction at quest completion. This is special reputation rewarding. Normal reputation reward to quest rewarding creature faction calculated and added automatically. 

RewHonorableKills
Number of honorable kill honor rewarded for completing this quest. 

Example: An example value is 15 for quest 8388: At level 70 an honorable kill is 20.9 honor worth. Multiply this with 15 and you receive 313.5, after the multiplication the value is rounded up. So the honor rewarded at level 70 is 314 for this quest. 

RewOrReqMoney
Money earned by completing the quest (if value > 0). Money quest requirement (if value < 0). 

RewMoneyMaxLevel
The money a character at level 70 would get when they complete this quest. This field also controls the XP given as the XP is calculated from the value in this field by the following formula. If the quest is repeatable, XP will be given only once. The total XP that a character will receive is also affected by the level difference between the character's level and the quest's level. 

The formula for calculating XP from the value in this field:
QuestLevel >= 65: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 6.0
QuestLevel == 64: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 4.8
QuestLevel == 63: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 3.6
QuestLevel == 62: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 2.4
QuestLevel == 61: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 1.2
QuestLevel <= 60: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 0.6 

RewSpell
Spell that is shown to be casted on quest completion in the quest log. Note that this spell will NOT be casted if RewSpellCast is non-zero. The spell in the other field will be casted instead, in which case the spell here only serves as the visual in the quest log. 

NOTE: This field comes straight from the WDB and should not be changed. 

RewSpellCast
Spell that will always be casted at player when completing the quest. This can be learn spell and player learned some spell in result, or buff spell, for example. If this field is non-zero then this spell will ALWAYS be casted and the spell in RewSpell will not. 

NOTE: This field comes straight from the WDB and should not be changed. 

RewMailTemplateId
If the quest gives as a reward an item from a possible list of items, the ID here corresponds to the proper loot template in quest_mail_loot_template. According to the rules in that loot template, items "looted" will be sent by mail at the completion of the quest. 

RewMailDelaySecs
How many seconds to wait until the mail is sent to the character that turned in a quest rewarding items from a loot template defined in RewMailTemplateId 

PointMapId
MapId of a quest point of interest (POI - Point Of Interest). POI will be shown on the map when quest is active. 

PointX
X coordinate of quest POI. 

PointY
Y coordinate of quest POI. 

PointOpt

Player must complete all three initial quests before D becomes available 

    *questA*    *questB*    *questC*
        \          |          /

Quests with split and a child quest 

Completing A unlocks B and C that can be done at the same time. They both need to be completed before D becomes available. X is needed to obtain item for C and this quest should only be available if C is active 

                *questA*
                /        \
           *questB     *questC* - *questX*
                \        /
                *questD*

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0        ExclusiveGroup = 0         NextQuestInChain = 0        entry = questD

Multiple quest chains, leading to one final quest 

Player may complete (not required to) X, but has to complete all three quest chains before final quest becomes available 

                *questX*
                   |

PrevQuestId = 0        NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questG

Complicated 

Player must first complete A, then B to unlock the chain from C to E. Three other quests in a group will also be unlocked, those can be done at the same time. The three grouped quests must all be completed before I becomes available. Completion of E and I is required to obtain the final quest.

Impossible - many quests may unlock many 

Player can choose between two alternative chains (Chain A or B, but not both chains). A2 or B2 should unlock C, D and E when complete. When all three complete, F should be unlocked. If player get A3 or B3 after complete F, depends on if chain A or B was chosen. 

                *questA1*           *questB1*

PrevQuestId = questF   NextQuestId = 0         ExclusiveGroup = 0          NextQuestInChain = 0         entry = questB3
Note: if player can choose between chain A or B may be determined by faction status (aldor or scryer), using ReqMinRepFaction = 1. Player should not be able to be neutral+1 with both at the same time. This may be the common threshold to obtain aldor or scryer quests (this is unsure). If that is the case, only the unlock of C, D and E after complete A2 _or_ B2 is the impossible part.

From UDB
(Redirected from Gossip scripts)

The `*_scripts` table 

This table format is used for 5 different tables to control possible scripts activated by different actions:

¦quest_end_scripts: Holds scripts activated when a player finishes a quest. 
¦event_scripts: Holds scripts activated whenever an event is activated, be it by an object or as the spell effect SPELL_EFFECT_SEND_EVENT (61).

Spell affect
From UDB

The `spell_affect` table 

This table holds information on what spells are affected by what spell mods. All spells in this table need to apply an aura that either adds a flat modifier to other spells or adds a percent modifier to other spells. Also, a single row in this table only holds information on a single spell effect that applies the aura. Therefore since a spell may have up to three effects, a maximum of 3 rows per spell is allowed. However, only the spell effects that apply the flat or percent auras will be used.

Spell chain
From UDB

The `spell_chain` table 

This table defines spell chains. A spell chain is a series of spells which all share the same name and all do the same thing; however, each has a different rank and as the rank increases, so does the spell damage/heal/etc values. This table also controls what spells are replaced by their more powerful later ranks; however, that is also decided by other factors as well (if mana costs for both spells are the same, etc). All fields in this table except rank are spell IDs from Spell.dbc.

first_spell
The very first spell in the chain. The spell put in this field is usually the Rank 1 spell version in the chain. If the ID used in spell_id is equal to the ID in this field (meaning that the spell we are looking at is the first one in the chain), then the rank must be either 0 or 1. 

rank
This field specifies what rank the spell in spell_id has.

Transports
From UDB

The `transports` table 

This table contains all type 15 transports (Boats and Zeppelins). All other transport types have their frame time read from TransportAnimation.dbc.

Field  Type  Null  Key  Default  Extra  
entry  int(10) unsigned  NO  PRI  0   
name  text  YES   NULL   
period  int(10) unsigned  YES   0   


Description of the fields 

entry
This is entry to be used for this transport from gameobject_template.entry. It must be a type 15 game object. 

name
This is an arbitrary name that is only used to describe this transport entry. 

period
This is the amount of time that it take for the transport to make one full pass through all the frames in TaxiNode.dbc. When a client change occurs, usually this field must be updated as Blizz changes the speeds of the transports on the official servers. The only known way to get this value is to ride the transports on the official servers and then tweak it until you get the proper value. This values in in milliseconds.
